### Project Description
The project's `goal` is to build a prototype (proof of concept) of an [Augmented Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) Ecosystem app.

This project is a first stage prototype of a larger concept to integrate AR experiences for public engagement and learning. Ultimately AR will be incorporated into a variety of spaces, within the scope of this project and in partnership with other attractions and tourism regions who are expressing interest in creating a connected platform for visitor engagement within local natural biomes.
