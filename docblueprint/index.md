## Executive summary
The Aquatic Biosphere Project of Canada engages individuals of all ages and backgrounds with Canada’s aquatic biosphere through presentations and media, community programs, and an upcoming public attraction. To that end, they hope to develop an Android/iOS application that uses augmented reality (AR) to enhance the device’s camera with fun and informative content about Canada’s nature. At the moment, the application is not funded. Our product will show potential investors that such an application is possible, hopefully securing funding for the Aquatic Biosphere Project to further develop the application.

When a user first opens the product, they will confirm their location in order to ensure the accuracy of the displayed information. The product will then open the device camera, and the user will be free to use it to scan their environment. When the user brings a relevant object into the camera view, the product will augment the object with the appropriate AR objects. Note that the product will only be tailored to environments within the University of Alberta North Campus.

## Project Glossary
- **augment** - add additional virtual objects into the camera view so that the objects look as if they are there in 3d space
- **camera view** - the live camera feed of a device that is made visible on the device’s screen
- **device** - a handheld computing device with an integrated camera and a screen, running the android/ios operating system
- **application** - software running on a device; in the context of the summary, it refers mostly to the proposed but undeveloped future application
- **product** - the proof-of-concept application currently being developed
- **AR object** - augmented-reality object; fun or educational information, which may come in the form of 3d models, lines of text, images, among other mediums
- **environment** - a set location with visible objects that remain fairly consistent; this will be used to consistently test different camera views
- **surface** - flat plane in the real world on which the AR objects are augmented on. It can be determined either by recognition or by the user; e.g. pond, marsh, park
