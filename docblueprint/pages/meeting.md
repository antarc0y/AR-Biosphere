# Meeting Minutes

??? abstract "Jan 18 / First Client Meeting"

    ## Main Purpose

    - Discuss project requirements with the client, clarify high level questions, and understand client's vision

    ## Attendance

    - Paula (Client), Yazeed (TA), the entire Biosphere team

    ## Q&A

    What are the overarching goals of the project?

    - Promote human interaction in biodiversity enhancement, eventually aim to 'game-ify' ecosystem interactions through AR for promoting aquatic conservation

    How many aquatic objects do we need to consider for models?

    - This prototype will be used in a fixed space with predetermined models, the app does not need to recognize new species or abiotic objects

    Would we have access to data on geo-location of ecosystems? Do we have to map specific areas?

    - Area mapping data will be provided by the Aquatic Biosphere of Canada

    How should information about AR objects be displayed?

    - Each object should be clickable, upon clicking a popup information fragment should appear with wikipedia-like information. Use simple language for young audiences, provide additional links to external web pages at the bottom of the fragment. 

    Do you have any software preferences?

    - Not specifically, but would prefer a platfrom that would likely stay constant over time.

    Would this project be open source?

    - TBD
