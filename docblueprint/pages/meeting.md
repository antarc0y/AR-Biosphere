# Meeting Minutes

??? abstract "Jan 18 / First Client Meeting"

    ## Main Purpose

    - Discuss project requirements with the client, clarify high level questions, and understand client's vision

    ## Attendance

    - Paula (Client), Yazeed (TA), the entire Biosphere team

    ## Q&A

    What are the overarching goals of the project?

    - Promote human interaction in biodiversity enhancement, eventually aim to 'game-ify' ecosystem interactions through AR for promoting aquatic conservation

    How many aquatic objects do we need to consider for models?

    - This prototype will be used in a fixed space with predetermined models, the app does not need to recognize new species or abiotic objects

    Would we have access to data on geo-location of ecosystems? Do we have to map specific areas?

    - Area mapping data will be provided by the Aquatic Biosphere of Canada

    How should information about AR objects be displayed?

    - Each object should be clickable, upon clicking a popup information fragment should appear with wikipedia-like information. Use simple language for young audiences, provide additional links to external web pages at the bottom of the fragment. 

    Do you have any software preferences?

    - Not specifically, but would prefer a platfrom that would likely stay constant over time.

    Would this project be open source?

    - TBD

    - Second internal deadline for assigned roles: Jan 27, to finish project management and teamwork documents

    - Sent Paula options for 3D animal models for her to choose from

??? abstract "Jan 25 / Sprint 1 Check-in Meeting"

    ## Main Purpose

    - Gather updates on all team members on their sprint 1 tasks

    ## Attendance
    
    - The entire biosphere team

    ## Important Takeaways

    - Team reached agreement on high level architecture to eb used for this project

    - All user stories were outlined

    - Software design diagrams were in progress

??? abstract "Jan 27 / Sprint 1 Final Updates"

    ## Main Purpose

    - Finalize all details of sprint 1 deliverables, provide feedback to other members' work

    ## Attendance
    
    - The entire biosphere team

    ## Important Takeaways

    - Plan to have all sprint 1 deliverables added to team documentation page by the end of the day

    - Finalize and make last minute edits software design diagrams, and user stories

??? abstract "Feb 1 / Second Client Meeting"

    ## Main Purpose

    - Update Paula on the sprint 1 items, show her low fidelity wireframes 
    - Comfirm that our high level designs align with her vision

    ## Attendance
    
    - Paula (Client), The entire biosphere team

    ## Important Takeaways

    - Paula confirmed that our architectural design and wireframes align with her specifications

    - Paula confirmed this project can be open source

    - Discussed frameworks and technologies amongst team members

    - Team to finalize decision between using Firebase or NodeJS as backend persistence layer, research the semanics between ARCore vs AR Foundation

??? abstract "Feb 6 / Sprint 2 Meeting, Sprint 1 Review"

    ## Main Purpose

    - Review of sprint 1 deliverables with Yazeed, consider feedback for sprint 2 updates
    - Comfirm tasks for sprint 2

    ## Attendance
    
    - Yazeed (TA), The entire biosphere team

    ## Important Takeaways

    - Architecture diagram, open source resources, and user stories needs to be updated for sprint 2

    - Sprint planning needs to be reconsidered, user stories should be more evenly distributed amongst sprint to avoid having one sprint with a much higher velocity

    - Decided to use Firebase Firestore as backend with Firebase database, because of team member familiarity and easy to use. Might consider transfering to NodeJS at later sprints because it is more scalable. Kevin assures us it is a simple transition. 

    - Distributed tasks for sprint 2:
        - Kevin: rebalance velocity of sprint planning, update story maps
        - V: design UI of landing page
        - Mohammad: set up Firebase, work on home page of app
        - Yui: design UI of landind page, update architecture diagram, general update of docs 
        - Raun: design UI of landing page, update user stories to match new sprints
        - Huy: update list of similar projects and open source projects
