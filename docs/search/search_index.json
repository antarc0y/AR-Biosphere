To that end, they hope to develop an Android/iOS application that uses augmented reality (AR) to enhance the device\u2019s camera with fun and informative content about Canada\u2019s nature. At the moment, the application is not funded. Our product will show potential investors that such an application is possible, hopefully securing funding for the Aquatic Biosphere Project to further develop the application.</p> <p>When a user first opens the product, they will confirm their location in order to ensure the accuracy of the displayed information. The product will then open the device camera, and the user will be free to use it to scan their environment. When the user brings a relevant object into the camera view, the product will augment the object with the appropriate AR objects. Note that the product will only be tailored to environments within the University of Alberta North Campus.</p>"},{"location":"#project-glossary","title":"Project Glossary","text":"<ul> <li>augment - add additional virtual objects into the camera view so that the objects look as if they are there in 3d space</li> <li>camera view - the live camera feed of a device that is made visible on the device\u2019s screen</li> <li>device - a handheld computing device with an integrated camera and a screen, running the android/ios operating system</li> <li>application - software running on a device; in the context of the summary, it refers mostly to the proposed but undeveloped future application</li> <li>product - the proof-of-concept application currently being developed</li> <li>AR object - augmented-reality object; fun or educational information, which may come in the form of 3d models, lines of text, images, among other mediums</li> <li>environment - a set location with visible objects that remain fairly consistent; this will be used to consistently test different camera views</li> <li>surface - flat plane in the real world on which the AR objects are augmented on.

Google Maps API will be used in the business layer to assist location detection. We will use Unity3D to build all AR related functionality through the AR Foundation Framework that allows adaptation to both Android and iOS without further changes. Tentatively, we want to use Django ORM as the persistence layer for accessing AR model data, and a PostgreSQL database for storing 3D models that we will use for the AR experience. Currently we plan on hosting the backend database on a Google Cloud server. This architecture diagram may be subjected to change in future sprints. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"pages/software/#uml-class-diagram","title":"UML Class Diagram","text":"<p>Our app can be divided into a number of central classes along with some helper ones. The user class makes calls that get the app user up and running like making calls that obtain the user's current location using the Location class (which further makes use of the class GeocoderResult that Google Maps API uses). The Camera class is responsible for displaying AR objects (which are classed as ARObject). ARObjects are heavily reliant on x, y, and z coordinates, which is why having a 3D vector class, Vector3, is convenient.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"pages/software/#sequence-diagram","title":"Sequence Diagram","text":"<p>The sequence diagram features the four most important interactions in our app: login, location recognition, camera view, and information view. From opening the app, users may choose to login. After which, all users must set their location either automatically through a built in maps API, or manually enter their location if the GPS is incorrect. Once location is set, users will be navigated to their camera view that allows them to point their camera at aquatic objects in order to see an AR of said object on screen. Users may view information about objects by clicking on them, where they may choose to navigate further to external Wiki sites through embedded links. Users may choose to save objects to their account database, if logged in.  </p>"},{"location":"pages/teamwork/","title":"Team Work","text":""},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#team-canvas","title":"Team Canvas","text":"<p>Below is the team canvas for our team </p>"},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#belbin-roles","title":"Belbin Roles","text":"<p>See https://www.belbin.com/about/belbin-team-roles.</p> Name Preferred Roles Manageable Roles Least Preferred Roles Mohammad Hammad IMP, CF, SP PL, TW, ME SH, RI, CO Raunak Agarwal SH, RI, IMP CO, PL, SP ME, TW, CF Vaibhav Chugh CO, IMP, CF ME, RI, SP SH, PL, TW Yui Han ME, IMP, CF SP, PL, SH RI, TW, CO Huy Ta CF, CO, TW SP, IMP, ME PL, SH, RI Kevin Sha PL, ME, IMP SH, SP, CF RI, CO, TW"},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#thinking-roles","title":"Thinking Roles","text":""},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#pl-plant","title":"PL (Plant)","text":"<p>Tends to be highly creative and good at solving problems in unconventional ways.</p> Preferred Manageable Kevin Sha Mohammad Hammad Raunak Agarwal Yui Han"},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#me-monitor-evaluator","title":"ME (Monitor Evaluator)","text":"<p>Provides a logical eye, making impartial judgements where required and weighs up the team's options in a dispassionate way.</p> Preferred Manageable Yui Han Mohammad Hammad Kevin Sha Vaibhav Chugh Huy Ta"},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#sp-specialist","title":"SP (Specialist)","text":"<p>Brings in-depth knowledge of a key area to the team.</p> Preferred Manageable Mohammad Hammad Raunak Agarwal Vaibhav Chugh Yui Han Huy Ta Kevin Sha"},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#action-roles","title":"Action Roles","text":""},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#sh-shaper","title":"SH (Shaper)","text":"<p>Provides the necessary drive to ensure that the team keeps moving and does not lose focus or momentum.</p> Preferred Manageable Raunak Agarwal Raunak Agarwal Yui Han Kevin Sha"},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#imp-implementer","title":"IMP (Implementer)","text":"<p>Needed to plan a workable strategy and carry it out as efficiently as possible.</p> Preferred Manageable Mohammad Hammad Huy Ta Vaibhav Chugh Raunak Agarwal Yui Han Kevin Sha"},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#cf-completer-finisher","title":"CF (Completer Finisher)","text":"<p>Most effectively used at the end of tasks to polish and scrutinise the work for errors, subjecting it to the highest standards of quality control.</p> Preferred Manageable Mohammad Hammad Kevin Sha Vaibhav Chugh Yui Han Huy Ta"},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#people-roles","title":"People Roles","text":""},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#ri-resource-investigator","title":"RI (Resource Investigator)","text":"<p>Uses their inquisitive nature to find ideas to bring back to the team. </p> Preferred Manageable Raunak Agarwal Vaibhav Chugh"},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#tw-teamworker","title":"TW (Teamworker)","text":"<p>Helps the team to gel, using their versatility to identify the work required and complete it on behalf of the team.</p> Preferred Manageable Huy Ta Mohammad Hammad"},{"location":"pages/teamwork/#co-co-ordinator","title":"CO (Co-ordinator)","text":"<p>Needed to focus on the team's objectives, draw out team members and delegate work appropriately.</p> Preferred Manageable Vaibhav Chugh Raunak Agarwal Huy Ta"}]}
